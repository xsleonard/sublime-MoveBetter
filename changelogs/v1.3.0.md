# Version 1.3.0

- Fixed bug where cursor would skip the current paragraph if it was within the first line or at the start of the next line
- Add an option to ignore lines that contain only whitespace when considering paragraph boundaries. The default is true, which is different from the previous behavior.
- Add `start_at_paragraph_begin` and `start_at_paragraph_end` options to stop at the beginning and end of paragraphs. `start_at_paragraph_begin` defaults to true which preserves the original behavior.
